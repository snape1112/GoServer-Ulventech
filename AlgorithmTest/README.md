# Algorithm Test


## Task: 
Given a list of 4 integers, find all possible valid 24 hour times 
(eg: 12:34) that the given integers can be assembled into and return the total number of valid times.

You can not use the same number twice.
Times such as 34:12 and 12:60 are not valid.
Provided integers can not be negative.
Notes: Input integers can not be negative.
Input integers can yeald 0 possible valid combinations.
> Example:
	```sh
	Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
	Valid times: ["12:34", "12:43", "13:24", "13:42", "14:23", "14:32", "23:14", "23:41", "21:34", "21:43"]
	Return: 10
	```
